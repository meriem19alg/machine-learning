## Overview

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques on various datasets. The goal is to explore different algorithms and evaluate their performance for real-world tasks.

**Key Features:**
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Implementation of machine learning algorithms
- Model evaluation and comparison
- Visualization of results

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project environment:

### 1. Clone the repository

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/meriem19alg/machine-learning.git

2. Navigate into the project directory

cd machine-learning

3. (Optional) Create a virtual environment (Recommended)

It's highly recommended to create a virtual environment for managing dependencies:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

4. Install required dependencies

Install the project dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file:

pip install -r requirements.txt

5. Verify installation

To verify that the environment and dependencies are installed correctly, run:

python -c "import numpy, pandas, sklearn"

If no errors are raised, the installation was successful.
Usage

Once the environment is set up, you can start running the machine learning models.
1. Run a model

Run the model training script by executing the following command. Replace model_name.py with the script you want to execute:

python models/model_name.py

2. Data Input

Ensure that you have placed any necessary data files (e.g., CSV, Excel) in the /data directory, or modify the script to point to the correct file path.
3. Customizing Parameters

You can modify hyperparameters or configurations for the models directly in the script files or through configuration files to experiment with different settings.
Models

This project includes various machine learning models. Some of the models implemented in the models/ directory include:

    Linear Regression: A simple algorithm for predicting continuous values.

    Logistic Regression: A model for binary classification tasks.

    Decision Tree Classifier: A tree-based algorithm for classification tasks.

    K-Means Clustering: An unsupervised learning algorithm for clustering tasks.

    Random Forest: An ensemble method for both classification and regression tasks.

For detailed descriptions of each model, check the corresponding scripts in the models/ directory.
Results

After running the model training scripts, the results (such as accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.) will be stored in the /results directory. You can visualize and compare the performance of different models.
Example Results:

    Model 1: Accuracy = 85%

    Model 2: Accuracy = 90%

    Model 3: Accuracy = 92%

Visualizations, such as confusion matrices and ROC curves, are included to help with model evaluation.

### 3. **Add `requirements.txt` file**

If you haven't already created a `requirements.txt` file, you can manually add common libraries used in machine learning:

Example `requirements.txt`:

```txt
numpy==1.24.2
pandas==1.5.3
scikit-learn==1.2.0
matplotlib==3.6.3
seaborn==0.11.2
tensorflow==2.10.0
keras==2.10.0
scipy==1.9.3

If you're using a virtual environment, run this command to generate a requirements.txt based on your environment:

pip freeze > requirements.txt

4. Add and Commit to Git

Once you have the README.md and requirements.txt ready, you can add them to your Git repository:

git add README.md requirements.txt
git commit -m "Add professional README and requirements.txt"
git push origin main
